name=Layer Group Filter
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Manage your Layer Filters (data subset) using layer-groups
version=0.1
author=Peter Bontinck
email=bontinck.p@gmail.com

about=Limit the dataset of all layers in a Layer group, by rolling-out similar attribute filters. You can describe your own set of filter presets using XML, so while using the plugin you just need to choose a preset and one common filter value. Supports value relations to other layers and non-uniform field names. Layer Filter presets (XML-string) are saved as a project variable.
